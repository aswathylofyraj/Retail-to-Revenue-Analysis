# Retail-to-Revenue Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** from the technical round, focusing on **data visualization** and **SQL analysis**. It covers two main subtasks:
1. **Subtask 1**: Data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset (Tesco).
2. **Subtask 2**: SQL analysis performed using PostgreSQL and PGAdmin, focusing on income-related insights.

## Subtask 1: Data Preprocessing and Visualization

### Dataset
The dataset used for this subtask is a retail dataset from Tesco, which contains product details such as price, availability, and brand.

### Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, standardizing the columns, and ensuring the data was ready for analysis.
2. **EDA**: Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover insights such as price distributions and product availability trends.
3. **Visualizations**: Generated the following key plots:
   - **Price Distribution**
   - **Product Count by Brand**

The Jupyter Notebook `Task_1_subtask_1.ipynb` contains the full code and analysis.

## Subtask 2: SQL Analysis

### Database
The SQL analysis was conducted using **PostgreSQL** on a dataset related to individual incomes. The database schema contains information about individuals' income, education, occupation, and other demographic attributes.

### Queries Performed
The following SQL queries were executed to extract insights:
1. Aggregate sum of `capital.gain` for individuals working in Government with more than 10 years of education.
2. Average age by education level.
3. Total `capital.gain` and `capital.loss` for each occupation.
4. Average age group of individuals working in Government and Non-Government sectors.
5. Average number of working hours for males and females in Government and Non-Government jobs.

The SQL queries can be found in the `queries.sql` file, and the results are provided in `query_results.txt`.

## How to Run

1. **Subtask 1 (Data Visualization)**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Retail-to-Revenue-Analysis.git
     ```
   - Open the Jupyter notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook subtask_1_data_visualization/eda.ipynb
     ```

2. **Subtask 2 (SQL Analysis)**:
   - Use the `queries.sql` file in a PostgreSQL environment to run the SQL queries.
   - The database setup and execution instructions are included in the file.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib
- PostgreSQL (for SQL queries)

## Conclusion

This project helped me apply data preprocessing, visualization techniques, and SQL querying to extract meaningful insights from retail and income datasets.
